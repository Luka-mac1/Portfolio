<h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

<h2 class="par" >Hackathon!</h2>
<p>This module taught us to work fast as a team. We were able to take concept and make it into something tht worked,
    even after trying and failing to do it another way</p>

<h2>cubing</h2>

<p class = "par">Cubing allowed us to bring algorithms from screen to life. The pyramix duo gave me something to grasp when it comes to algorithms.

    
    <h2>Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Our presentation we made on bluetooth was interesting and showed how technology is still evolving.
    I also learned how bluetooth works which helped me think about how someone coded it</p>

<h2>Intro to JS</h2>
<p class = "par">This module taught the basics of javascript. I have learned other languages in the past,
    so this helped me take my knowledge from them and apply the same ideas to javascript.</p>
</div>


<h2>Intro to css and html</h2>
<p class = "par">This unit taught me how to comfortably write simple code in html and be able to style it.
    Before this course I would always have to google every single thing I wanted to add but now I can do things
    fairly comfortably and I'm always improving.</p>


<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p class="par">Algorithms are essential for many programs. I have written quicksort algorithms in the past and our daily management
    table used algorithms to sort</p>

<h2>Computers</h2>
<p class = "par">This module was interesting to me because I find it very interesting that a bunch of small switches can
    send so much information and allow us to write code like me right now.</p>

<h2>The Internet</h2>
<p class = "par">This module taught me how packets are sent and the importance of IP adresses.
    It also taught me the importance of encryption</p>


<h2>Advanced Games and Visualization</h2>
<p class = "par">In this module I learned to transform images in javascript.
   The language I am more comfortable in is c++ so it was very different working with a canvas and visual coding.</p>

<h2>Creative Refactoring</h2>
</p class = "par">This project was important because we started from scratch and very quickly made a working game
that was ctually fun and playable. Then after we got the game down, we had to change things up and understand what 
each thing means more and more.</p>

<h2>How will you continue learning about computer science?</h2>
<p class = "par">I plan on going into software engineering for university. Bother of my parents do software engineering and it's
    an emerging area in the world with many job opportunities. I want to learn another language or two and make something 
    pretty big like an app or product at some point. By taking advanced functions and calcuus in school I can lean the mathematical
    concepts to improve my ability to code and have a better way to understand computer science.</p>

<h2>How does computer science/programming give you what you need to continue learning?</h2>
<p class = "par">Computer science can spill into other subjects when it comes to learning ability. What I mean by that is something
    like algorithms requires thinking and mathematical reasoning which can help understand mathematical concepts in a different way.
    For example quicksort you would have to make sure the recursion is working properly. I remember from last year I kept having issues
    with the recursion but eventualy I figured it out.
</p>

<h2>How can art helpt guide you through learning about programming and computer science?</h2>
   <p class = "par">Art can help guide people to learn computer science and proggraming by giving them something easy to look
       at and actually understand. With art you can see whats being changed live and making sure everything looks aesthetically 
       pleasing means usign more skill and helps you understand stuff like loops and build in functions like "ellipse". What I'm trying 
       to say is if someone said "put a circle on the screen", yeah pretty much anyone can do that, but if they asked to draw the sun,
       and maybe a tree, you couldn't just do it instantly, you would have more things to think about</p>
