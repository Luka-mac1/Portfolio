</h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

<h2 class="par" >Hackathon!</h2>
<p>This module taught us to work fast as a team. We were able to take concept and make it into something tht worked,
    even after trying and failing to do it another way</p>

<h2>cubing</h2>

<p class = "par">Cubing allowed us to bring algorithms from screen to life. The pyramix duo gave me something to grasp when it comes to algorithms.

    
    <h2>Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Our presentation we made on bluetooth was interesting and showed how technology is still evolving.
    I also learned how bluetooth works which helped me think about how someone coded it</p>

<h2>Intro to JS</h2>
<p class = "par">This module taught the basics of javascript. I have learned other languages in the past,
    so this helped me take my knowledge from them and apply the same ideas to javascript.</p>
</div>


<h2>Intro to css and html</h2>
<p class = "par">This unit taught me how to comfortably write simple code in html and be able to style it.
    Before this course I would always have to google every single thing I wanted to add but now I can do things
    fairly comfortably and I'm always improving.</p>


<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p class="par">Algorithms are essential for many programs. I have written quicksort algorithms in the past and our daily management
    table used algorithms to sort</p>

<h2>Computers</h2>
<p class = "par">This module was interesting to me because I find it very interesting that a bunch of small switches can
    send so much information and allow us to write code like me right now.</p>

<h2>The Internet</h2>
<p class = "par">This module taught me how packets are sent and the importance of IP adresses.
    It also taught me the importance of encryption</p>


<h2>Advanced Games and Visualization</h2>
<p class = "par">In this module I learned to transform images in javascript.
   The language I am more comfortable in is c++ so it was very different working with a canvas and visual coding.</p>

<h2>Creative Refactoring</h2>
</p class = "par">This project was important because we started from scratch and very quickly made a working game
that was ctually fun and playable. Then after we got the game down, we had to change things up and understand what 
each thing means more and more.</p>
